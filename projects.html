                            Designed and coded a digital watch on 
                            a BASYS3 board, in Verilog, for 
                            ENGR 230 - Digital Design. The watch used the 
                            4 seven-segment displays to display hours and 
                            minutes and 6 LEDs to display seconds in binary.
                            Additionally, the last 2 LEDs were used to display AM/PM. 
                            The digital watch also contained 4 input buttons 
                            allowing the user to set the time by increasing and 
                            decreasing the hour and minute counters.</p>

                        The goal of 
                        the proposed system was to monitor and identify inattentiveness and 
                        drowsiness in drivers by way of electromyography (EMG) to monitor eye 
                        blink rate, electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor brain activity, and 
                        electrocardiography (ECG) signals to monitor heart rate. Through this 
                        research it was determined that single-channel EEG from the channel F7 
                        electrode, placed near the temple above the frontal lobe, was a suitable 
                        and convenient location for determining drowsiness and alertness in 
                        drivers, producing an average accuracy of 67.378%. From the observed 
                        data it was possible to locate and identify decernable patterns 
                        indicative of drowsy and alert states in the F7 channel. These results 
                        furthered the goal of creating an accessible, non-invasive, compact 
                        system able to automatically detect distracted and drowsy driving to 
                        act as a warning system, alerting users of inattentive and dangerous 
                        behavior. </p>

                    <div class="cell small-12 large-12"><h3>Wearable Posture Monitoring System</h1></div>
                        <div class="cell small-12 large-6"><p>
                        </br>
                        The goal of the proposed system was to automatically track a user's 
                        postural positions throughout the day through the use of a non-invasive, 
                        wearable system and automatically provide feedback to change their posture. 
                        This was done by placing 
                        magnets in the form of a rectangular grid on a shirt as well as an MMR sensor 
                        on the chest of the body. The onboard magnetic sensor records the data values 
                        from the grid of magnetics, which is then, along with data recorded from the 
                        onboard accelerometer, analyzed to determine the position of the user. A trained 
                        algorithm recognizes and automatically detects the spinal position of the user from
                        the recorded data points and provides direction to alter posture. These 
                        recommendations act as a warning system and allow the user to self-monitor to 
                        prevent back and neck pain and reduce the chance of long-lasting damage that can result from poor posture.
